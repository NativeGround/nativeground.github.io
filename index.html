<p>Sustainable spaces enable efficient and prosperous living by virtue of location, time, cost of living, culture and climate. We are developing a geospatial solution that enables an individual to make an informed choice based on quantifiable metrics of Where to Live. Coworking spaces, hyperlocal schooling, energy efficiency, ambient noise and water quality are some points of interest. Traditional superfoods and location-specific nutrition facilitate a holistic and healthy living experience. We are working on profiling and reviving traditional nutrition sources and techniques. Apart from reducing the carbon footprint of nutrition-import, this is expected to help an individual to acclimatize faster to a location and live there in harmony. Intelligent wearables is a euphemism for climate-conscious sustainable clothing. We are also working on concepts that could leverage energy from fibers to power ubiquitous mobile devices, at the very least.</p>
