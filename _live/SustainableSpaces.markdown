We are developing a geospatial solution that enables an individual to make an informed choice of "Where to Live" based on quantifiable ease-of-living metrics. Some of these metrics will include water-quality score, air-quality score, noise-levels, traffic-quality score, nodality score (based on proximity to coworking spaces, hyperlocal schooling etc). 

Metrics:
