Intelligent wearables is a euphemism for climate-conscious sustainable clothing. We are also working on concepts that could leverage energy from fibers to power ubiquitous mobile devices, at the very least.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
